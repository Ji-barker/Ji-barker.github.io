              <p>All binary numbers have positionings, meaning the whole binary number is broken up into individual numbers but with whole binary numbers, the positionings go from right to left instead of left to right starting at zero with decimal.</p>
              <p>To convert a whole binary number to a decimal</p>
              <ol>
                <li>2 is powered by the positioning then times by that binary value.</li>
                <li>Move to the next binary position and its value and repeat the first process adding together each time</li>
                <li>Repeat until been though each element in the binary number. </li>
              </ol>
              <P>For example converting 1010 to decimal</p>
